The main goal of this project is provide a port of Unrar library to iOS platform.

Currently we have two projects:

* Unrar4iOS

This project makes easy to build the unrar library as iOS static library.

* UnrarExample

This project give to us an example about how to use unrar in a iOS application.

Feel free to contribute with enhancements.


Installation:

Please open Unrar4iOS on XCode and build it, the framework package will be generated on build folder of project, copy it to a folder of your project  and add as existing framework to your project.


Notes:

Since this Unrar4iOS is cpp based library you will need to change the extension of classes that uses Unrar4iOS to .mm it will allow us to include  libstdc++ on linking stage, otherwise you will need to add libstdc++ as linker flags in you application.
